                            <p>Dr. Bruce Banner lives a life caught between the soft-spoken scientist he’s always been and the uncontrollable green monster powered by his rage.</p>

Banner helps Thor prevent Ragnarok and returns to Earth.In "Avengers: Infinity War" (2018), Banner struggles to transform into the Hulk but plays a crucial role in the fight against Thanos.

                                    <p>I’m not going to spoil anything but WOW!!!!
                                        Last night I started by seeing The Marvels than went home and watched The Finale of Loki Season 2. Both were top notch. I’ll start with The Marvels. Captain Marvel has always kind of been an unlikeable superhero for me because she’s so stoic. Having Kamala khan and Monica Rambeau in this movie helped Captain Marvel have more of a personality. The movie was sooooo much fun.</p>

                                    <p>** spoilers alert *** Avengers: Endgame in one word simply fantastic!!!!!!!!!!. I am a massive marvel fan. Have seen every single marvel cinematic universe film release ever since it all really kicked off with the first iron man back in 2008 (the mind boggles this was over 10 years ago). I had very high expectations going into this film and I was not disappointed. The amount of humour moments was a surprise but very welcome.</p>

                                    <p>Marvel has always been a huge part of my childhood ever since I watched Iron Man in theaters for the first time in 2008, it sparked my interest in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and I would never have imagined that it would be where it is now. 11 years, 23 Movies, as the years went by, I started loving these characters.Avengers Endgame concludes story arc of many of our beloved superheroes who have entertained us, inspired us made us laugh, make us cry. </p>

                                    <p>No spoilers: This is by far one of the greatest cinematic events in history. This film was just a pure masterpiece. To be honest, the beginning was pretty slow, but after an hour and a half, the movie got epic. What a way to conclude the story of marvel's most beloved heroes.</p>

                                    <p>No spoilers for Iron Man (2008). This is just a few of my own thoughts and opinions. I'll TRY not to gush on and on forever. But let's be real....I'll probably fail.Look, I'm not going to take all that time out of my life in order to review every single one of the 37,000 MCU films to date. BUTT! I will take the time to write a loving, albeit short, review for the one that started it all.</p>
